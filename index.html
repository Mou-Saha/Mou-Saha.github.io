            <h1>AI-COVID</h1>
            <h2>An Agent-Based Model for Predicting Pandemic Trajectories</h2>
            <p>In the AI-COVID project, I was part of a dedicated team that leveraged the power of agent-based modeling to forecast the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Utilizing advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, we created a dynamic model capable of simulating various scenarios and predicting infection rates under different conditions. Our work has been crucial in providing actionable insights for a wide range of stakeholdersâ€”from government agencies and healthcare providers to the general public. This project served as a testament to the potential of AI in public health, and it enriched my experience in data engineering, machine learning, and collaborative research.<a href="url">https://github.com/Mou-Saha/AI-COVID</a>

              <!-- Through the agent-based model, the project simulates the behavior and interactions of individuals within a population, considering factors such as demographics, movement patterns, and social interactions. By incorporating real-time data and continuously updating the model, it generates predictions on the spread of infections under different scenarios and protective measures.
              
              The predictions generated by the AI-COVID project offer crucial information for decision-makers. Government healthcare authorities can leverage these insights to formulate effective policies and strategies to control the spread of the virus. Healthcare providers can optimize resource allocation and prepare for potential surges in hospitalizations, ensuring adequate medical care for patients. Citizens can make informed decisions about personal protective measures, such as social distancing and mask-wearing, based on the projected impact on infection spread.
              
              By providing a comprehensive understanding of the potential outcomes of different protective measures, the AI-COVID project enables stakeholders to proactively respond to the evolving pandemic situation. This data-driven approach empowers decision-makers with the knowledge needed to implement targeted interventions, allocate resources efficiently, and minimize the impact of the virus on public health and the economy.
              
              Overall, the AI-COVID project serves as a valuable tool in the fight against the pandemic, offering insights that can guide decision-making at various levels. By leveraging agent-based modeling and artificial intelligence, this project contributes to the collective effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and protect the well-being of individuals and communities. -->

            <h1>Healthcare App for Enhanced Medical Services</h1>
            <h2>Streamlining Access to Healthcare Services through an Android Health App</h2>
            <p>The Android health app developed using Android Studio and a Cloud server is a comprehensive solution designed to provide users with a convenient and centralized platform for various healthcare-related needs. This app offers a wide range of features and functionalities to enhance the user experience and facilitate access to essential healthcare services.

              <!-- One of the primary functionalities of the app is the ability for users to find doctor's appointments. This feature enables users to search for healthcare professionals based on their specialization, location, and availability. Users can easily book appointments, view doctor profiles, and access essential information such as qualifications, reviews, and ratings.
              
              Additionally, the app includes a feature to search for blood donors. Users can quickly search for potential blood donors in their vicinity based on blood type and availability. This functionality helps streamline the process of finding blood donors during emergencies or planned blood transfusions.
              
              Moreover, the app provides real-time information about blood availability at nearby blood banks. Users can easily check the availability of specific blood types and make informed decisions about accessing blood supplies. This feature proves to be particularly beneficial in critical situations where immediate access to blood can save lives.
              
              The app also allows users to register as blood donors, contributing to a larger blood donor database. By registering, users can offer their willingness to donate blood and receive notifications when their blood type is needed. This feature helps in building a robust network of blood donors and facilitates quick and efficient blood donation processes.
              
              Furthermore, the app offers online consultation and primary check-up services. Users can seek medical advice from healthcare professionals through secure and confidential online consultations. This feature eliminates the need for physical visits, especially for minor health concerns, and enables users to access healthcare services remotely.
              
              Overall, the Android health app developed using Android Studio and a Cloud server is a comprehensive and user-friendly solution that empowers individuals to manage their healthcare needs effectively. By integrating various functionalities, such as doctor appointment booking, blood donor search, blood availability tracking, blood donor registration, and online consultations, the app aims to provide a convenient and centralized platform for users to access essential healthcare services.             -->
